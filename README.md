# Hello-World
Intro and Learning Device

This change is being made as part of the Hello-World GitHub tutorial.

I am fairly well versed with numerical and functional use of python.
I am a novice in the world of C/C++. Both of these languages I learned
while applying them to my scientific research in Physics. 

I recieved my B.S. Physics from Purdue University in early 2016 at the 
age of 32. Graduating was the culmination of a path I set myself on 
in 2006. I spent over six years in the military so that I could go 
to college. Now, I set myself on another path to make the past ten years 
worth the road.

Moving forward I hope to use my knowlege of physics and my preliminary 
knowlege of computers and coding to move into the realm of product creation.
Products do no necessarily need to be "for profit". To me the excersize of 
the mind. Or, rather, the pursuit of knowlege gained, is the goal that 
motivates the project in the now.
